## ✏️ Design Decisions

### 🔍 Issues With the Original
- Outdated layout and visuals
- Text-heavy interface lacking clear hierarchy
- Form had too many fields and dropdowns
- Weak CTA (Call-To-Action) visibility
- Little visual branding or engagement elements

### 🛠️ Improvements in the Redesign
- **Simplified Form**: Reduced form fields to essentials (name, email, optional phone)
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Headline placed at top, form centered with bold CTA
- **Brand Trust**: "Trusted by thousands" tag added
- **Modern UI**: Used icons, soft shadows, and rounded elements for a clean, professional look
- **Enhanced CTA**: Bold green "Get Price" button
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized spacing for better mobile layout
